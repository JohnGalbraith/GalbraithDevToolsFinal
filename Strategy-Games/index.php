            <p>Sometimes you want to relax and play a game that is a little slower paced but you also dont want something too easy. This is where strategy games come to save the day. Often Stategy games can be played with only the keyboard meaning they are perfect for the days you just want to lay in bed or curl up in a blanket on the couch. Not only that often Strategy games give you lots of time to plan out your actions meaning if you want to get up and walk away from your computer for a drink or a snack you dont need to worry about finding a good time to do so you can just get up whenever.</p>
            <h2>Faster Than Light</h2><img src="../img/FTL.jpg"><p>Easily one of my favourite Strategy games, brutely difficult and with endless decisions and optimizations to be made. I know some people who have played the game for years and could count on one hand the number of times theyve one. Despite being so difficult, it never feels unfair. The game literally gives you an infinite amount of time to think and make decisions. It is even encouraged, by simply pressing the space bar time is frozen and you can queue up all the actions you wish to take. Since there is no time pressure it always leaves you thinking through every decision before you make it. or at least that what you should do. With FTL it is often in those short moments where you decide not to pause or you think youre in the clear that disaster strikes. Reminding you that if you are a little more careful next time you could improve and get further. It some how manages to thread a line where you almost never win but you feel as though you were a hair away from victory making you want to load up the game again and again.</p><h2>Kingdom New Lands</h2><img src="../img/Kingdom.png"><p>In contrast to Faster than Light this game is much less difficult. In Kingdom you are the ruler of a fallen kingdom and your objective is quite simple, collect money and build your kingdom. There is one problem though, every night a group of monsters called the greed come to attack your kingdom, thier objective, anything shiney, including the crown on your head. The main draw to this game is less the immediate challenge from the game itself but rather a challenge of self improvement. The greed are a undefeatable enemy who get stronger and stronger every night until you are eventually over run. At first this might be realtively quickly but as you get to know the game more and learn how to make money more efficently you are able to last longer and longer. The game has a pretty generous amount of time in its day night cycle so you dont ever feel rushed and the music is quite peaceful. This is a game I would highly recomend for anyone. Whether they are a veteran gamer who wants to min max and see how long they can last or if they are a casual who just wants to enjoy the slow pace and relaxing music</p>
