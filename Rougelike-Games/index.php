            <p>RougeLike and Dungeon Crawlers are some of my favourite games of all times. For those not familiar these are games where you slowly collect items as you progress through the game making your character stronger and stronger as you go. The catch is you only have one life, if you die thats it, you have to start all the way from level one and try again. This results in games that are quite challenging but also very rewarding as you slowly learn the game and get better and better the more you play. Tipically these games are shorted and more focused on replayability. Usually each run through the game is randomized with different enemies, areas and items. This makes every play through the game unique and exciting. It also means that when you are still learning sometimes you get lucky with really great items giving you a rush of excitement as you are easily able to beat enemies you previously struggled with. It also means once you get good at the game sometimes you get unlucky with bad items meaning you need to fight for every inch you progress in the game making the win that much more satisfying if you manage to pull it off.</p><br><h2>The Binding of Isaac</h2><br><img src="../img/Binding%20Of%20Isaac.jpg"><p>This is the game that started my love of dungeon crawlers. For years my favourite types of video games were platformers. I was always on the lookout for new and more challenging platformers. Eventually this lead me to Super Meat Boy. A notoriously difficult platformer made by Edmund McMillan. Playing through the game was extremely difficult but also very rewarding. Thats what lead me to look into more challenging games. Having enjoyed Super Meat Boy I looked into Edmunds other games and that is when I found The Binding of Isaac. <img src="../img/Super%20Meat%20Boy.jpg"><br>I absolutely loved the style of game and the difficulty. Not only that, the randomization of the levels meant that it had far more replayability than other games I had played. Thats when I truely fell in love with the genre and why I chose to talk about it rather than other classically hard games like bullet hells or souls like games which are also genres I love. For those who are up for a challenge and are okay with a little bit of cartoon gore the binding of isaac is a must try</p>
